# Manual QA Portfolio

## About Me  
I am a Manual QA Tester with hands-on experience testing live web and mobile applications. My work focuses on functional, UI/UX, regression, and exploratory testing. I approach quality assurance with a structured, analytical mindset and enjoy breaking down complex systems into clear, testable components.  
This portfolio showcases real QA deliverables created during various training projects and practical assignments, without revealing any confidential client information.

## Projects & Experience  
Due to confidentiality agreements (NDA), specific project names and business details cannot be shared.  
However, the materials in this repository represent work completed on several live and production-level applications, including:

• Functional, UI/UX, and regression testing for active web and mobile products  
• Manual testing for B2C and B2B platforms in collaboration with distributed QA teams  
• Participation in closed beta testing cycles prior to public releases  
• Contribution to QA processes for real client projects with documented test artifacts  
• Reporting issues using industry-standard bug-tracking tools (Jira, ClickUp)

The deliverables included here reflect my testing approach, technical skillset, and documentation quality across different product environments.

## Tools & Technologies  
• Jira, ClickUp – Issue tracking and project collaboration  
• Qase, TestRail (concepts) – Test case and test run management  
• Postman – API testing, collections, and environment setup  
• GitHub – Version control and documentation  
• Chrome DevTools – Debugging, network and console inspection  
• SQL (basic queries) – Data validation and backend verification  
• Figma – UI review and requirements clarification  

## What I Learned & Worked With  
Throughout my training and practical projects, I gained experience in:

• Writing clear, structured test cases and high-level test scenarios  
• Designing smoke, sanity, usability, and regression checklists  
• Creating detailed and reproducible bug reports with proper severity/priority  
• Performing exploratory, boundary, compatibility, and UI testing  
• API testing with Postman (requests, assertions, environments)  
• Using SQL to validate data and test backend logic  
• Reviewing designs in Figma and comparing design vs. production behavior  
• Understanding QA processes, SDLC, STLC, and Agile workflows  

This repository organizes all of these deliverables so employers can evaluate my practical QA skills.
