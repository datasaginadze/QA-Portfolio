# Learning Notes – Manual QA


## Software Development Fundamentals

### Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)  
Understanding stages: requirements → design → development → testing → deployment → maintenance.

### Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)  
Requirement analysis, test planning, test design, test execution, reporting, closure.

### Development Methodologies  
- **Waterfall**  
- **Agile** (Scrum, Kanban)  

Roles, ceremonies, artifacts (Sprint, Backlog, Daily Standups).


## Testing Concepts

### Testing Principles  
Early testing, defect clustering, context-dependency, etc.

### Testing Levels  
- Unit  
- Integration  
- System  
- Acceptance  

### Testing Types  
- Functional  
- Non-functional  
- Change-related (Smoke, Sanity, Regression)

### Test Design Techniques  
- Equivalence Partitioning  
- Boundary Value Analysis  
- Decision Table Testing  


## Test Documentation

### Test Planning  
Understanding test scope, risks, constraints, and objectives.

### Traceability Matrix  
Mapping requirements to test cases.

### Test Case Creation & Execution  
Writing clear test cases with preconditions, steps, expected results.  
Executing test cases and documenting outcomes.

### Bug Reporting  
Creating reproducible bug reports with correct severity/priority.  
Experience with Jira, Trello, ClickUp, Qase, TestCaseLab.

### Test Summary Reports  
Final reporting after test cycles.
